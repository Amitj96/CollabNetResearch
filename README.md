# CollabNetResearch
This research addresses questions of the size and dynamics of collaboration networks at the data creation stage in relation to productivity and rate of knowledge transfer as represented by publications and patents. Based on the metrics and research framework, metadata from GenBank and other sources, such as patent data from the US Patent and Trademark Office and funding data from NIHâ€™s ExPORT, is processed and analyzed with descriptive statistics and models from Complex Network Analysis.  With this, we are studying not only the topological properties of the data submission and publication networks, but also the temporal ordering of collaborative relationships and the overlap of sequence submission and publication networks. Through slicing, plotting, and visualizing data, appropriate sampling strategies and algorithms are developed to more deeply explore collaboration networks, both structurally and temporally.
